# Miro Developer Platform Printed CLI Agent Guide

This directory is a generated `miro-developer-platform-pp-cli` printed CLI. It was produced by [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press), so treat systemic fixes as upstream Printing Press fixes first. Keep local edits narrow and document why a generated-tree patch belongs here.

## Local Operating Contract

Start by asking the generated CLI for current runtime truth:

```bash
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli doctor --json
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli agent-context --pretty
```

Use runtime discovery instead of relying on a copied command list:

```bash
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli which "<capability>" --json
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli <command> --help
```

Add `--agent` to command invocations for JSON, compact output, non-interactive defaults, no color, and confirmation-safe scripting:

```bash
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli <command> --agent
```

Before running an unfamiliar command that may mutate remote state, inspect its help and prefer a dry run:

```bash
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli <command> --help
miro-developer-platform-pp-cli <command> --dry-run --agent
```

Use `--yes --no-input` only after the target, arguments, and side effects are clear.

For install, auth, examples, and longer product guidance, read `README.md` and `SKILL.md`. This file intentionally stays small so repo-local agents get invariant local guidance without duplicating the generated docs.

## Local Customizations

If you modify this CLI beyond what the generator produced, record each customization so it isn't lost on the next regen and is visible to the next reader.

1. **Mark every changed site** in source with a comment summarizing the deviation:

    ```
    // PATCH: <one-line summary>
    ```

    Include an upstream reference inline when there is one (e.g. `// PATCH(upstream cli-printing-press#<issue>): ...`). `grep -rn 'PATCH' .` from this directory then surfaces every customization.

2. **Catalog the change** in a `.printing-press-patches.json` at this CLI's root (parallel to `.printing-press.json`). Minimum shape:

    ```json
    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "applied_at": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "base_run_id": "<copy from .printing-press.json>",
      "base_printing_press_version": "<copy from .printing-press.json>",
      "patches": [
        {
          "id": "short-identifier",
          "summary": "What changed (one sentence).",
          "reason": "Why this customization was needed (one or two sentences).",
          "files": ["internal/cli/foo.go"],
          "validated_outcome": "Optional: non-obvious test result that confirms the fix.",
          "upstream_issue": "Optional: https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/issues/<n>"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

This file is an **index of customizations**, not a second copy of the diff. Diffs live in `git`; code lives in the source files; the inline `// PATCH:` comment carries the local semantics. Keep `summary` and `reason` short -- if you find yourself writing tables of field renames or code transformations, that detail belongs in the source comment or commit message, not here.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
